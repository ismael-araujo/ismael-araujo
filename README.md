## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

  <img align="right" alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/abhisheknaiidu/blob/master/code.gif?raw=true" width="40%" height="40%" /><br>
I'm a Data Scientist based in New York City with a background in Marketing and Business Intelligence. Passionate about solving problems and telling stories using data.  

Invite me for a hot coffee (black, please) to chat about that new machine learning algorithm that you just learned about, and we will be best friends.

You can find me running by the river, reading about astrophysics at public parks in NYC, or translating Data Science courses from English to Portuguese at coffee places.<br>

## Projects

**[Hotel Reviews Analysis Using NLP and Machine Learning](https://github.com/ismael-araujo/Hotel-Reviews-Analysis-Using-NLP "Hotel Reviews Analysis Using NLP and Machine Learning")**

Hotels can receive hundreds of reviews every day and itâ€™s easy to lose track of them. Thinking of that, I created a project using Natural Language Processing that was able to analyze which features have the highest impact on guests when they write a review, get insights about the hotel in a few seconds, and classify reviews with 82% accuracy. 

**[Predicting Fetal Risk Using Cardiotocographic Data](https://github.com/ismael-araujo/Predicting-Fetal-Risk-Using-Cardiotocographic-Data- "Predicting Fetal Risk Using Cardiotocographic Data")**

One of the most important goals of the humanity is reducing child mortality. This was the inspiration for this project that uses cardiotocographic data to predict child health and avoid unnecessary c-sections. The final model was able to predict child health status with an F1-Score of 0.978.

## What Am I Working On:

Currently, I'm working on my capstone project for my Master's in Data Science at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul. It's schedule to be done by the end of June 2021 and I can't wait to share it with you.
